# Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. <emph class="sidenote">For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.</emph> This package provides output formats to create "Tufte-style" handouts. 

Tufte-style handouts make heavy use of the right margin. Our package provides templates for creating these types of documents in pdf or html format. The pdf format uses the tufte-handout document class <emph class="sidenote">Credit: <http://code.google.com/p/tufte-latex/></emph>. The html format uses bootstrap with some css to put stuff in the margin. Each uses knitr hooks to specify the types of figures. 

# Usage

To create sidenotes in html, some raw html is required. Place the sidenote content between the tags `<emph class="sidenote"></emph>` to place them in the sidebar. In the pdf version, simply use the pandoc footnote format `^[Content]`.

The package provides two custom hooks for figure placement. The first is `marginfigure`. Set `marginfigure = TRUE` in a chuck option to place a figure in the right margin. Optionally, specify the figure size and include a caption. 

```{r fig1, tidy = TRUE, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, echo = TRUE, marginfigure = TRUE, fig.cap = "This is a marginfigure"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(y = mpg, x = wt)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

The html documents may not display correctly on narrow screens. It seems to look OK as narrow as 900px. When in doubt, specify the figure size.

The second custom hook is `fig.star`. Setting `fig.star = TRUE` creates a full-width figure spanning the main body and the margin. Specify the width and height for best results. 

```{r fig2, tidy = TRUE, fig.width = 22, fig.height = 3, fig.cap = "Full-width figure", fig.star = TRUE}
ggplot(faithful, aes(y = eruptions, x = waiting)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "loess")
```

Finally, normal figures are plotted in the main body, with the captions in the margin. The only option necessary here is the caption itself.

```{r fig3, tidy = TRUE, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = "Normal figure with caption in the margin"}
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions)) + geom_histogram()
```
